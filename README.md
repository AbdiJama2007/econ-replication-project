# Econ Replication Project

## Overview
This project is part of academic activities that I will be undertaking in the course of the next six months to build a research profile for the intention to position myself a predoc position
In it, I aim to replicate the research conducted by Nathan Nunn. The provided data files have been sourced from his website and include shape files and data tables necessary for the analysis. The analyses were performed using Python, focusing on reproducing the main ideas presented in Nunn's work.
The analyses were perfomed using python, focusing on reproducing the main ideas represented in Nunn's work. 


## Data Files
The data files uploaded to this repository include:
- borders_tribes.dbf
- borders_tribes.prj
- borders_tribes.sbn
- borders_tribes.sbx
- borders_tribes.shp
- borders_tribes.shp.xml
- borders_tribes.shx
- slave_trade_QJE.dta

## Shape Files:
These ESRI Shapefiles contain geographical information, such as boundaries, polygons, and other spatial data, necessary for spatial analysis.
They delineate the geographical regions under study, providing a framework for spatial analysis.
#def: an ESRI Shapefile is a simple, nontopological format for storing the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features.

## Data Tables:
The main data table is in Stata formata (.dta)
This dataset includes the target variable, representing the primary outcome or the phenomena of interest, along with corresponding independent variables. 
These independent variables encompass endogenous, exogenous, and instrumental variables, which play distinct roles in the analysis.

## Python Analysis:
The analysis was carried out using python
Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and others were used to replicate the main ideas presented in Nathan Nunn's work.
